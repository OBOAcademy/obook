# Practical introduction to OAK Lexmatch

In this tutorial, we will learn to use a very basic lexical matching tool (OAK Lexmatch). The goal is not only to enable the learner to design their own matching pipelines, but also to to think about how they fit into their mapping efforts.

## Pre-requisites

- [Introduction to mapping curation with SSSOM](../explanation/semantic-matching.md)
- [ROBOT tutorial (merge)](../tutorial/robot-tutorial-2.md)
