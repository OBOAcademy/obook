# Practical introduction to OAK Lexmatch

In this tutorial, we will learn to use a very basic lexical matching tool (OAK Lexmatch). The goal is not only to enable the learner to design their own matching pipelines, but also to to think about how they fit into their mapping efforts.

## Pre-requisites

- [Introduction to mapping curation with SSSOM](../explanation/semantic-matching.md)
- [ROBOT tutorial (merge)](../tutorial/robot-tutorial-2.md)


## Tutorial

- [Setting up OAK, preparing the ontology](#prepare): You will learn how to install OAK into a new Python environment, and create a simple `Makefile` to prepare your input ontology with ROBOT.
- [Introduction to lexical matching with OAK lexmatch](#run):  You will run lexmatch on the input and learn to interpret the results.
