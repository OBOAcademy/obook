### Basics of prompt engineering for Ontology Developers

A prompt is essentially a set of words you feed to ChatGPT, prompting it to generate some text in response.
Providing an effective prompt to ChatGPT is an art form, and as resources like [learnprompting.org](https://learnprompting.org/) testify, one that requires cultivation and care. The better you become at writing prompts, the more value you will draw from ChatGPT for your daily ontology curation tasks. How effective our prompts are depends on the exact language models used in ChatGPT (at the moment 3.5 or 4), which means that this lesson will keep evolving.

Currently we have identified the following concrete use cases for ChatGPT in daily ontology curation activities:

1. Doing research on definitions
2. Finding equivalent concepts in widely known terminologies
