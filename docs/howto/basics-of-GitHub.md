# The Basics of GitHub: Organizations, Repositories, & Issues

### Signing up for Github

1. Sign up for Github at [github.com](http://github.com).
1. After signing up, your Username will be your **Github handle**. This serves as your unique identity on the platform and is used to log in, reference your profile, and mention you in discussions.
   **Note**: You can go to [Settings](https://github.com/settings/profile) to provide additional personal information, connect ORCID id, and customize your avatar.

### Understanding Organization and Repository 

1. **Organization**: A shared account that allows groups to collaboratively manage multiple repositories with centralized access control, permissions, and team management. Organizations own repositories (instead of individual users) and enable admins to manage members, teams, security settings, and integrations across all projects.
  - Example: [https://github.com/zappfish](https://github.com/zappfish), [https://github.com/monarch-initiative](https://github.com/monarch-initiative)

2. **Repository (repo)**: A storage space on GitHub where your project’s files, code, or documentation are kept. It tracks every change made to those files, allowing collaboration, version control, and issue tracking.
  - Example: [https://github.com/zappfish/zapp-atlas](https://github.com/zappfish/zapp-atlas) 

### Creating an Issue from a Repository

1. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository (e.g. [https://github.com/zappfish/zapp-atlas](https://github.com/zappfish/zapp-atlas)).
2. Under your repository name, click **Issues**.
