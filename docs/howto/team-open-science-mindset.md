# How to be a team open science player

## How to contribute to Open Ontologies, Data and Software beyond coding and curation

Traditionally, we consider software code and ontology/data curation as the most valuable contributions in our domain. However, there are many other ways to positively influence and impact the long-term trajectory of our community. Here, we explain how to be a "team open science player" - independent of wether you are a software engineer, and ontology curator, a data scientist or a user.

1. When you find an answer on Stack Overflow (or similar) that helps you, _upvote it_. It cannot be stressed enough how important this is to let good answers float up to the top (become more visible), and recognise the time and energy people spend formulating answers.
1. If you cannot find an answer to a question on Stack Overflow, and you figure out a solution consider answering it yourself! Consider this: if you provide an answer that will result in only 6 open science people spending one hour less solving a problem (a conservative estimate), you saved the taxpayer 6 hours of salary (not to speak of improving the quality of the solutions)!
1. Answer questions on GitHub issues even when on trackers not in your purview. People often falsely assume that they should not try to answer queries in an open source project that they are not directly involved with. This is wrong! Open source developers highly (!) appreciate it when you chip in on answering queries, from dealing with errors and exceptions to "How do I?" kind of queries. **Get involved on other peoples issue trackers**!
1. Before asking questions on slack or issue trackers, **always do basic search first**. Consider (1) the projects documentation, (2) open _and closed_ issues on the issue tracker of the project your query is related to. If you do not find the information you need try and craft questions that are concise yet give sufficient context. To enable future users to find these answers, consider using the issue tracker instead of slack!
1. Make yourself responsible for continuously improving open science documentation: from software tools to libraries and ontologies, we are all in this together. If a question was answered on slack or in an issue, consider a 10 minute detour to update the documentation of the project to reflect the solution if you think it could be helpful!
1. Good documentation is as important as good quality code, and everyone can help our here even if it "only" about formatting, typos and adding additional links!

## How to be an open science ontologist

### Goals

We want our community ontology editors and developers to be _excited_ to be part of this open science process. Any small changes that you contribute can have a big impact on our downstream users.

### This guide aims to empower our our community ontology editors and developers to do the following:

1. **Take ownership of our community ontologies**

    - Ensure that you see your issues and Pull Requests through to the end
    - Feel empowered to nag reviewers or experts to help

Example: After waiting for the PR to be reviewed, Meghan kindly asked Nicole if she should find a different reviewer.

1. **Reduce the fear of breaking the ontology**

    - We've all probably already made the same mistakes before - it's okay to break things or or make mistakes.

Example: The QC checks on [this PR](https://github.com/monarch-initiative/mondo/pull/5266) failed 6 times before it passed.

<img width="788" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6722114/190459249-e52957a6-8d8f-4ba8-bd7d-547039a7c76d.png">

    - We have so many checks in place and GitHub has version control. Nothing has ever been broken to the point where it can't be fixed. (Remember to work on a branch!)
    - Perfect is the enemy of good enough.
    - It's okay if your PR is rejected.

1. **Be proactive**

    - Problem of decentralization and lack of hierarchy needs proactive and brave decision makers.
    - No one will do your work for you.
    - Learn the tools using OBOOK, make fixes - just try it/do it.
    - Can improve the materials by fixing it (please feel empowered to fix anything, including typos and content).

1. **Be an open scientist**

    - Contribute things openly so other people can benefit from it
    - Don't put issues on Slack where the public can't see it
    - Create public tickets
    - Create tickets on external ontology trackers when you spot issues in other ontologies

Example: While curating Mondo, Nicole identified issues relevant to Orphanet and created this [issue](https://github.com/Orphanet/ORDO/issues/31).

<img width="1265" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6722114/190462261-3a46a3aa-1cec-4f1e-a77d-cf5fef16b34e.png">


Example: There is overlap between Mondo and Human Phenotype Ontology and the Mondo and HPO curators tag each other on relevant tickets.

Example: In Mondo, if new classifications are made, Mondo curators report this back to the source ontology to see if they would like to follow our classification.

1. **Find a buddy**

    - Pair up with someone who will review your PRs and you will review their PRs

1. **Be clear and inclusive**

    - Take the time to write proper, detailed responses, avoid being vague or terse
    - Sloppy, quick responses can cause more work than not responding at all
    - Bullet lists, checklists for action items
    - Hide unnecessary details and with details tag: <details><summary>[click arrow to expand]</summary>. See [example here](https://github.com/OBOFoundry/OBOFoundry.github.io/pull/1978#issuecomment-1183176682)
    - Undercut any aggressive comments
    - Link to external issues

Example:

<img width="643" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6722114/190461543-4be5e98e-0436-4d1a-ad91-60e371a71eff.png">

1. **Reduce work for others as others as much as possible**
1. **Be positive and show proactive gratitude**

    - If a member of the community opens an issue, always thank them for the issue right away. We need to encourage people to open issues.
    - Don't let issues linger without any response
    - When giving feedback, be positive and constructive
    - Show appreciation: thank users for issues and thank a reviewer for their PR
