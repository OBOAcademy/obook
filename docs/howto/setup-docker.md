# Set up docker

- Follow the instructions [here](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac) (note these instructions are for a Mac).
- Once installed, you should be able to open your command line and download the ODK.
    - Open Terminal
    - in the command line type, type `docker pull obolibrary/odkfull`. This will download the ODK (will take a few minutes, depending on you internet connection).
- Setting the memory:
  Set memory ~60% of your system memory, for example, if you have 16GB of RAM, then you should assign 10-11.
