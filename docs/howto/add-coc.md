## Adding a Code of Conduct to your repository

To include a Code of Conduct (CoC) in your ontology repository, first create a dedicated file named `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` in the root directory of your repository. This file should clearly articulate the community's expected behaviors, identify unacceptable conduct such as harassment or discrimination, and describe the mechanisms through which community members can confidentially report any violations. You may base your document on widely recognized templates such as the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) or established examples like the [OBO Foundry's Code of Conduct](https://obofoundry.org/docs/COC.html). Once created, prominently link your CoC from the repository's `README.md`, contribution guidelines (`CONTRIBUTING.md`), and other prominent documentation pages to ensure it is easily discoverable.

It is important to tailor your CoC to the specific project it is applied to. Various features of the project, including its size, its primary stakeholders and funding situation imply different aspects of the COC to apply, or in need to be specifically highlighted.

For example, there would be no point in having a CoC that advises to report violations to a “conflict resolution team” if the project itself is a two-person show. Project features like conflict resolution teams are only suitable for projects whose community has reached a certain size.

Furthermore, make sure that all aspects of the COC are actually actionable. For example, when the COC talks about a "point of contact" (POC) to reach out to, it is important to make sure that the means of contact are explicitly mentioned, and that the POC can reliably be reached this way.

So, don’t pick just any CoC without thinking. Pick a CoC that works for your project.
