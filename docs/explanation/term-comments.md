# Term Comments

## What are comments? 

Comments are annotations that may be added to ontology terms to further explain their intended usage, or include information that is useful but does not fit in areas like definition.

Some examples of comments, and possible standard language for their usage, are:

WARNING: THESE EXAMPLES ARE NOT UNIVERSALLY USED AND CAN BE CONTROVERSIAL IN SOME ONTOLOGIES! PLEASE CHECK WITH THE CONVENTIONS OF YOUR ONTOLOGY BEFORE DOING THIS!

## Do Not Annotate

This term should not be used for direct annotation.  It should be possible to make a more specific annotation to one of the children of this term. 

Example:
GO:0006810 transport 

Note that this term should not be used for direct annotation. It should be possible to make a more specific annotation to one of the children of this term, for e.g. transmembrane transport, microtubule-based transport, vesicle-mediated transport, etc. 

## Do Not Manually Annotate
This term should not be used for direct manual annotation.  It should be possible to make a more specific manual annotation to one of the children of this term.   

Example:
GO:0000910 cytokinesis

Note that this term should not be used for direct annotation. When annotating eukaryotic species, mitotic or meiotic cytokinesis should always be specified for manual annotation and for prokaryotic species use 'FtsZ-dependent cytokinesis; GO:0043093' or 'Cdv-dependent cytokinesis; GO:0061639'.  Also, note that cytokinesis does not necessarily result in physical separation and detachment of the two daughter cells from each other.

## Additional Information

Information about the term that do not belong belong in the definition or gloss, but are useful for users or editors. This might include information that is adjacent to the class but pertinent to its usage, extended information about the class (eg extended notes about a characteristic of a cell type) that might be useful but does not belong in the definition, important notes on why certain choices were made in the curation of this terms (eg why certain logical axioms were excluded/included in the way they are) (Note: dependent on ontology, some of these might belong in editors_notes, etc.). 

Standard language for these are not given as they vary dependent on usage.
