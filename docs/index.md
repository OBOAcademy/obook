# On becoming an OBO Semantic Engineer

Welcome to our OBO Semantic Engineering Training!

## Introduction to documentation 

Documentation in the obook is organised* based on the [diataxis framework](https://diataxis.fr/) of documentations into 4 distinction sections: 

1. Tutorials

Tutorials are learning-oriented documentation in which there are exercises to help a beginner achieve basic competence in that area. 

2. How-to Guides

How-to Guides are task-oriented documentation that function as directions that guide the reader through the steps to achieve a specific end.

3. Reference

References are information-oriented documentation that describe, as succinctly as possible, and in an orderly way, a 

4. Discussion

Discussion (or explanation) are understanding-oriented documentation that clarifies, deepens and broadens the readerâ€™s understanding of a subject.

*Note: we are in the process of transforming the documentation accordingly, please be patient if some of the documentations are still not in their correct place. Feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/OBOAcademy/obook/issues) if you find something that you suspect isn't in place.

Critical Path Institute (CPI) is an independent, nonprofit organisation dedicated to bringing together experts from regulatory agencies, industry, and academia to collaborate and improve the medical product development process.

In April 2021, the CPI has commissioned the first version of this OBO course, contributing not only funding for the preparation and delivery of the materials, but also valuable feedback about the course contents and data for the practical exercises. We thank the CPI for contributing significantly to the OBO community and open science!
