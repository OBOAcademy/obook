# OBO Academy - Monarch Training Series

## Goal

The goal of this course is to provide ongoing training for the OBO community. As with previous tutorials, we follow the [flipped classroom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom) concept: as organisers, we provide you with materials to look at, and you will work through the materials on your own. During our biweekly meeting, we will answer your questions, provide you with additional demonstrations where needed and go into depth wherever you as a student are curious to learn more. This means that _this course can only work if you are actually putting in the time to preparing the materials_. That said, we nevertheless welcome anyone to just lurk or ask related questions.

## You (Students)

- Read the ["Getting started" guide](../getting-started.md)
- Check which lessons interest you in the upcoming schedule - just participate in the ones you care about
- Prepare the lessons (between 3 and 7 hours of preparation time)
- Prepare questions for the revision sessions (without questions, the revision sessions will be silent and awkward)
- Make detailed issues on our [issue tracker](https://github.com/jamesaoverton/obook/issues) when materials are broken, hard to follow or need more details - that is really important as we rely on you to help to improve our materials continuously.
- Request new course units from us using the issue tracker.

## Notes

Most of materials used by this course were developed by James Overton, Becky Jackson, Nicole Vasilevsky and Nico Matentzoglu as part of a project with the Critical Path Institute (see [here](../index.md)). The materials are improved as part of an internal training program (onboarding and CPD) for the Phenomics First project (NIH / NHGRI #1RM1HG010860-01).

Thanks to Sarah Gehrke for her help with project management.
