### Ontology Level Annotations

Annotations on the active ontology tab are ontology level annotations and contain metadata about the ontology.
This includes:

1. title (name of the ontology)
1. description
1. license
1. contributors (ideally this should be in ORCID but many ontologies use names instead)
1. references (under rdfs:comment)
1. preferred_root (this allows certain browsers to know which root to display the ontology from)

## Entities tab

Entities are where your "entries" in the ontology live and where you can add terms etc.
