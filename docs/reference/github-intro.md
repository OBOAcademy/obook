# Git, GitHub and GitHub Desktop (version control)

A repository can consist of many files with several users simultaneously editing those files at any moment in time. In order to ensure conflicting edits between the users are not made and a history of the edits are tracked, software classified as a "distributed version control system" is used.

All OBO repositories are managed by the **Git** version control system. This allows users to make their own local branch of the repository, i.e., making a mirror copy of the repository directories and files on their own computers, and make edits as desired. The edits can then be reviewed by other users before the changes are incorporated in the 'main' or 'master' branch of the repository. This process can be executed by running Git line commands and/or by using a web interface (Github.com) along with a desktop application (GitHub Desktop).
