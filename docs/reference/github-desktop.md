# GitHub Desktop

For most of our training activities, we recommend using [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). It provides a very convenient way to push and pull changes, and inspect the "diff". It is, however, not mandatory if you are already familiar with other git workflows (such as command line, or Sourcetree).
