# Monkeying around with OWL

An index page to find some of our favourite articles on Chris' blog.
These are not _all_ articles, but I selection we found useful during our every work.

## Ontology development and modelling

- [OntoTips Series](https://douroucouli.wordpress.com/2019/03/09/ontotips-a-series-of-assorted-ontology-development-guidelines/). Must read series for the beginning ontology developer. 

- [Warning about complex modelling](https://douroucouli.wordpress.com/2021/03/24/avoid-mixing-parthood-with-cardinality-constraints/). Chris is generally big on Occam's Razor solutions: given two solutions that solve a use case, the simpler is better.

- [OntoTip: Donâ€™t over-specify OWL definitions](https://douroucouli.wordpress.com/2019/07/29/ontotip-dont-over-specify-owl-definitions/). From the above OntoTip series.

- [How to deal with unintentional equivalent classes](https://douroucouli.wordpress.com/2018/09/04/debugging-ontologies-using-owl-reasoning-part-2-unintentional-entailed-equivalence/)

## Ontology curation

- [OntoTip: Write simple, concise, clear, operational textual definitions](https://douroucouli.wordpress.com/2019/07/08/ontotip-write-simple-concise-clear-operational-textual-definitions/). One of our favourite blog posts of Chris. Must read!
