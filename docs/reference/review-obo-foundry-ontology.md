# Reference Guide on How To Review an OBO Foundry Ontology

## Overview

The mission of the OBO Foundry is to develop a family of interoperable ontologies that are both logically well-formed and scientifically accurate. To achieve this, OBO Foundry participants follow and contribute to the development of an evolving set of [principles](https://obofoundry.org/principles/fp-000-summary.html) including open use, collaborative development, non-overlapping and strictly-scoped content, and common syntax and relations, based on ontology models that work well, such as the [Gene Ontology (GO)](http://geneontology.org/).
