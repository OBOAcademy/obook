# Getting Hands on with Ontologies

## Prerequisites

Sign up for a free [GitHub](https://github.com/join) account

## Preparation
No advance preparation is necessary.

_Optional_: If you are unfamiliar with ontologies, this [introduction to ontologies](https://oboacademy.github.io/obook/explanation/intro-to-ontologies/) explanation may be helpful.

## What is delivered as part of the course

**Description:** The purpose of this lesson is to train biomedical researchers on how to find a term, what to do if they find too many terms, how to decide on which term to use, and what to do if no term is found.

### Learning objectives

- Understand open source ontology community development
- Identify the best ontology or ontologies for annotation of biomedical data
- Find ontology terms and chose the best ontology term
- Make new term requests

## Lesson

### Introduction to Community Based Ontology Development

This how to guide on [How to be an Open Science Engineer - maximizing impact for a better world](https://oboacademy.github.io/obook/howto/open-science-engineer/) has a lot of details about the philosophy behind open science ontology engineering. Some key points are summarized below.

- The ontologies that I will promote in this lesson are part of the [OBO Foundry](https://obofoundry.org/), a community of ontology developers that are committed to developing _open, freely available, community_ ontologies under a share set of guiding principles, that ensure the ontologies are _interoperable, scientifically accurate_, amongst other qualities.
- A key feature of the success* of our ontologies is the **community** who contributes to them. (*I claim they are successful because they are widely used in biomedical curation, databases, bioinformatics and computational analyses.)
- [Principle of Collaboration](../howto/open-science-engineer/#collaboration):
    - These ontologies rely on community contributions and many are not funded. We value your expertise in making new term requests, requesting changes or commenting on existing tickets.
    - The OBO Academy has a lot of self-paced learning material, if you are inclined to learn how to contribute directly to ontologies.
    - Join Slack channels and email lists.
    - Reduce work for others as much as possible by communicating clearly.
    - Be positive and generous with gratitude and attribution.
    - Promote truly open communication: Create public tickets which can be searched and referred to later.
- [Principle of Upstream Fixing](../howto/open-science-engineer/#principle-of-upstream-fixing)
    - Report an bugs or errors to the source ontology.
    - Make term requests for any missing terms.
- [Principle of No Ownership](../https://oboacademy.github.io/obook/howto/open-science-engineer/#principle-of-no-ownership):
    - Ensure that you see your issues through to the end.
    - Feel free to nudge ontology curators.

### Where to find ontology terms and how to chose the right terms

See lesson on [Using Ontologies and Ontology Terms](https://oboacademy.github.io/obook/lesson/ontology-term-use/)

### How to make new term requests

See [How to guide on Make term requests to existing ontologies](https://oboacademy.github.io/obook/howto/term-request)

### Exercise

1. Sign up for a [GitHub account](https://github.com/) if you do not already have one. (Some of the exercises can be done without being signed into GitHub).
2. **Search for an ontology term in [OLS](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/index)**: 
    - Search for 'exhaust exposure'. Note how many results you get. Do you have a sense of how to select the appropriate term for your annotations?
3. **Make a new term request for a missing term**:
    - Suppose you want a more general term than already exists: exhuast exposure. Using the instructions in [How to guide on Make term requests to existing ontologies](https://oboacademy.github.io/obook/howto/term-request), make a new term request to an appropriate GitHub repository for an ontology, such as [ECTO](https://github.com/EnvironmentOntology/environmental-exposure-ontology). (Note, since this is just for practice, please do not submit the ticket.)
