# AI-powered semantic engineering

AI-powered semantic engineering is a pathways to help using AI more effectively.

This is a placeholder for a comprehensive Getting Started Guide at [https://ai4curation.io/aidocs/](https://ai4curation.io/aidocs/) (follow issue [here](https://github.com/ai4curation/aidocs/issues/44)). [https://ai4curation.io/aidocs/](https://ai4curation.io/aidocs/) complements OBO Academy and is developed by people deeply involved in both resources. We decided a separate resource was needed due to the large amount of new and experimental materials emerging in the era of AI.
