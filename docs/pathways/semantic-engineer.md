# Semantic Engineer Pathway

## Getting Set-up

1. Download and install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
2. Download and install [Protege](https://protege.stanford.edu/products.php)
3. Install [ELK reasoner in protege](../howto/installing-elk-in-protege.md)
4. [Setting up ODK](../howto/odk-setup.md)

## Learning

As a semantic engineer, it would be useful for you to know how curators work, as such, it would be useful to be familiar with all the concepts in the [ontology curator pathways document](ontology-curator.md). This pathways will however be focusing on the engineering side of things.

### Very basics

1. [Basic introduction to CLI 1](../tutorial/intro-cli-1.md)
1. [Basic introduction to CLI 2](../tutorial/intro-cli-2.md)

### Learning Git and GitHub

1. [Fundamentals of GitHub](../tutorial/github-fundamentals.md)
1. [Github issues](../tutorial/github-issues.md)
1. [Cloning a Repo](../howto/clone-mondo-repo.md)
1. [Creating pull requests](../howto/github-create-pull-request.md)

### Learning semantic engineering

1. [ROBOT tutorial pt. 1](../tutorial/robot-tutorial-1.md)
1. [ROBOT tutorial pt. 2](../tutorial/robot-tutorial-2.md)
1. [Templates](../lesson/templates-for-obo.md)
1. [Getting started with DOSDP templates](../tutorial/dosdp-overview.md)
1. [DOSDP Templates Basic Tutorial](../tutorial/dosdp-template.md)
1. [Introduction to Managing DOSDP Templates in ODK](../tutorial/dosdp-odk.md)
1. [Basics of SPARQL](../tutorial/sparql.md)
1. OAK
1. SSSOM
1. makefile (introduction, pipelines, syntax, optional flags, run.sh)
1. Docker
1. Some common ontologies, properties, and relationships (RDF, RDFS, oboInOwl, etc)

## Semantic Engineer How To Collection

This section is a non-ordered collection of how to documents that an engineer might need (this includes everything from the curators list as they may be pertinent knowledge to an engineer).
