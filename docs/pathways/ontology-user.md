# Ontology User Pathway

Description: This pathway includes resources on ontology use, such as how to use ontologies when annotating data, how to use ontologies for search and data analysis, and specific use cases.

**Preparation**: A basic understanding of what ontologies are is helpful. Some introductory resources are below:

- [Introduction to Ontologies](explanation/intro-to-ontologies.md)
- [Introduction to ontology semantics and reasoning](https://henrietteharmse.com/2023/02/17/introduction-to-ontology-semantics-and-reasoning/) by Henriette Harmse
