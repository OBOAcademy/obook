# Ontology User Pathway

Description: This pathway includes resources on ontology use, such as how to use ontologies when annotating data, how to use ontologies for search and data analysis, and specific use cases.

**Preparation**: A basic understanding of what ontologies are is helpful. Some introductory resources are below:

- OBO Academy [Introduction to Ontologies](../explanation/intro-to-ontologies.md)
- [Introduction to ontology semantics and reasoning](https://henrietteharmse.com/2023/02/17/introduction-to-ontology-semantics-and-reasoning/) by Henriette Harmse

## General Ontology Use Guidelines

- OBO Academy [Using Ontologies and Ontology Terms](../lesson/ontology-term-use.md)
- Elixir's [Selecting terminologies and ontologies](https://faircookbook.elixir-europe.org/content/recipes/interoperability/selecting-ontologies.html)
- Elixir's [Ontology mapping with Ontology Xref Service (OxO)](https://faircookbook.elixir-europe.org/content/recipes/interoperability/ontology-alignment-oxo.html)
- [Biological ontology use guidelines](https://henrietteharmse.com/2022/02/02/biological-ontology-use-guidelines/) by Henriette Harmse

## Gene Ontology curation

- [Curating and browsing with Gene Ontology (GO)](http://geneontology.org/)
- [Gene Ontology handbook](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4939-3743-1)
