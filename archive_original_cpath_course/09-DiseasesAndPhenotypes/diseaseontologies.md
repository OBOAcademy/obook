@nicolevasilevsky and @matentzn to fill in after lesson.

## Overview of important disease ontologies

@nicolevasilevsky

- Describe the fundamental difference between an ontology and a terminology again.
- Disease Ontology
- Mondo
- ICD10/11 (are these)

## Why do we need phenotype and disease ontologies at all?

@matentzn (practical examples, terminological variation)

Three central use cases:

- Data integration
  - Entity resolution and retrieval: Having one thing to refer to across datasets
  - Efficient integration of other external sources
- Analysis
  - Data grouping
  - NLP pipelines

This is a tough question to approach, and there is no generally applicable answer. Indeed, we recommend to the aspiring semantic engineer to be generally weary of one-stop-shop claims - the better mindset is

Criteria:

- Is it an ontology or a terminology
- Is it comprehensive and actively developed
- Does it curate precise mappings
