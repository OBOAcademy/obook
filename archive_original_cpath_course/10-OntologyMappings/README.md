# Week 10: Ontology Mappings

**First Instructor:** Nico Matentzoglu  
**Second Instructor:** Nicole Vasilevsky

## Description

Last week, we got an initial idea on _why_ we would want to map our data to ontologies.
One approach to map our data to do it manually - in fact, this is often the preferable
approach. This week, we will take a closer look at approaches of **how** to map your data to ontologies, and hopefully enable you to make informed choices which techniques are suitable
in which situation.

## Topics

- A rough typology of ontology mapping approaches
- The case for open science - and the importance of contributing
- Review: what to do when you need a term
