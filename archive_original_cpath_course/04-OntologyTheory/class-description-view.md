## The Class description view

We have seen how to add sub/superclasses and annotate the class hierarchy. Another way to do the same thing is via the Class description view. When an OWL class is selected in the entities view, the right-hand side of the tab shows the class description panel. If we select the 'vertebral column disease' class, we see in the class description view that this class is a "SubClass Of" (= has a SuperClass) the 'musculoskeletal system disease' class. Using the (+) button beside "SubClass Of" we could add another superclass to the 'skeletal system disease' class.

Note the Anonymous Ancestors. These are superclasses that are inherited from the parents. If you hover over the Subclass Of (Anonymous Ancestor) you can see the parent that the class inherited the superclass from.

#### Revising a superclass:

1.  If you want to revise the superclass, click the 'o' symbol next to the superclass and replace the text. Try to revise 'musculoskeletal system disease' toÂ  'disease by anatomical system'.

2.  If you want to delete a superclass, click the 'x' button next to the superclass. Delete the 'disease by anatomical system' superclass.
