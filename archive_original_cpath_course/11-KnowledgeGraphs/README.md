# Week 11: Knowledge Graphs: from deterministic to statistical reasoning

**First Instructor:** Nico Matentzoglu  
**Second Instructor:** TBD

## Description

In previous lessons we have discussed how to build ontologies, build ontology-based data pipelines with `make` and ROBOT and map our data to ontologies. Today, we will show you how to think of your semantically enriched data as a knowledge graph, and discuss how ontologies can help you exploiting it.

## Learning outcomes

You will:

1. have a firm idea of _why we should map our biomedical data to ontologies_ and be able to present key arguments to your stakeholders
2. understand _what knowledge graphs are_ and how ontologies fit into the picture
3. get excited about the prospects of knowledge graph analytics and start thinking about how to leverage this emerging technology in your own work

## Topics

- [Knowledge Graph and Ontologies: Overview](kgs.md)
- [Using Knowledge Graphs to generate insight](insight.md)
- [Practical exercise](exercise.md)

## Semantic Engineer Toolbox

- [Neo4J Desktop](https://neo4j.com/download/): Neo4J is a graph database (Labelled Property Graph model) that enables nice graph queries using Cypher, a quite useful visual tool for exploring your graph and a mature suite of graph analysis tools, like path analysis (shortest path etc) and connectivity (connected components, communities).
- [RDF4J](https://rdf4j.org/documentation/): A wrapper for triple stores with a nice backend and API.

## Materials

- [HPI: Knowledge Graphs](https://open.hpi.de/courses/knowledgegraphs2020/overview): Week 5 and Week 6
