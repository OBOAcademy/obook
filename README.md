Critical Path Institute (CPI) is an independent, nonprofit organisation dedicated to bringing together experts from regulatory agencies, industry, and academia to collaborate and improve the medical product development process.

In April 2021, the CPI has commissioned the first version of this OBO course, contributing not only funding for the preparation and delivery of the materials, but also valuable feedback about the course contents and data for the practical exercises. We thank the CPI for contributing significantly to the OBO community and open science!
